This directory contains a version of the interpreter written in C
modified so as not to use the Boehm garbage collector but reference
counting instead. 

This is completely standard ANSI C.  As far as I can see, it has no
system dependencies at all and should work on practically anything.

To compile use

  $CC $CFLAGS -o unlambda unlambda.c

where $CC is your C compiler (for example, gcc) and $CFLAGS are your
favorite compilation options (I suggest -O6 -Wall -ansi).

To run, use

  ./unlambda inputfile.unl

where inputfile.unl is the Unlambda source program.  If no file is
specified, the interpreter will read it from the standard input (in
which case the program's input, if any, should come after the program
itself).
